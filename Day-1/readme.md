# Day-1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

**Objective:**  
Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for Machine Learning tasks.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1. Import the dataset and explore basic information (null values, data types).  
2. Handle missing values using mean, median, or imputation techniques.  
3. Convert categorical features into numerical values using encoding methods.  
4. Normalize or standardize numerical features.  
5. Visualize outliers using boxplots and remove them if necessary.  

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task

**What I Learned:**  
- How to explore a dataset and understand its structure using Pandas.  
- Techniques to handle missing data effectively.  
- Methods to convert categorical features into numerical values suitable for ML models.  
- How to normalize or standardize data to improve model performance.  
- How to detect and visualize outliers, and decide when to remove them.  
- Gained hands-on experience in Python data preprocessing and basic visualization.
