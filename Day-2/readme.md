# Day-2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:**  
Understand the dataset using statistics and visualizations to identify key patterns, trends, and insights.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1.Generate summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.).
2.Create histograms and boxplots for numeric features.
3.Use pairplot/correlation matrix for feature relationships.
4.Identify patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data.
5.Make basic feature-level inferences from visuals.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task  

**What I Learned:**  
- How to summarize and explore data using Pandas (`.describe()`, `.info()`, etc.)  
- Techniques to handle missing or inconsistent data effectively.  
- How to visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn for clearer interpretation.  
- Methods to identify and interpret outliers using boxplots.  
- How to detect relationships between features using correlation heatmaps and pairplots.  
- The importance of visual storytelling in uncovering insights and patterns in data.
