# Day-3: Linear Regression

**Objective:**  
Implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1.Import and preprocess the dataset.
2.Split data into train-test sets.
3.Fit a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear model.
4.Evaluate model using MAE, MSE, R²
5.Plot regression line and interpret coefficients.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task  

**What I Learned:**  
- How to understand relationships between features and target variables using Linear Regression.
- How to split data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- How to train a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.
- How to evaluate model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.
- How to interpret regression coefficients to understand feature importance.
- How to visualize predictions using regression plots and actual vs. predicted graphs.
- Gained hands-on experience in implementing and analyzing Linear Regression in Python.
