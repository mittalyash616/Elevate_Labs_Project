# Day-3: Linear Regression

**Objective:**  
Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for Machine Learning tasks.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1.Import and preprocess the dataset.
2.Split data into train-test sets.
3.Fit a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear model.
4.Evaluate model using MAE, MSE, R²
5.Plot regression line and interpret coefficients.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task  

**What I Learned:**  
- How to explore a dataset and understand its structure using Pandas.  
- Techniques to handle missing data effectively.  
- Methods to convert categorical features into numerical values suitable for ML models.  
- How to normalize or standardize data to improve model performance.  
- How to detect and visualize outliers, and decide when to remove them.  
- Gained hands-on experience in Python data preprocessing and basic visualization.
