# Day-6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

**Objective:**  
Understand and implement KNN for classification problems.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Graphviz

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1.Choose a classification dataset and normalize features.
2.Use KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.
3.Experiment with different values of K.
4.Evaluate model using accuracy, confusion matrix.
5.Visualize decision boundaries.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task  

**What I Learned:**  
- Loaded and preprocessed data using Pandas and scikit-learn.
- Normalized features for better KNN performance.
- Trained and tested the KNN model with different K values.
- Evaluated results using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Visualized decision boundaries and accuracy trends.
- Gained basic understanding of model building and evaluation.
