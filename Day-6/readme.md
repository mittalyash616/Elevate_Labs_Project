# Day-6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

**Objective:**  
Understand and implement KNN for classification problems.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Graphviz

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1.Choose a classification dataset and normalize features.
2.Use KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.
3.Experiment with different values of K.
4.Evaluate model using accuracy, confusion matrix.
5.Visualize decision boundaries.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task  

**What I Learned:**  
- How to build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression.
- How to split and standardize data for better model performance.
- How to train and evaluate a model using metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- How the sigmoid function works and converts outputs to probabilities.
- Gained hands-on experience in implementing Logistic Regression in Python.
