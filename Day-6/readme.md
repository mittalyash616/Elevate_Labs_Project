# Day-5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

**Objective:**  
Learn tree-based models for classification & regression.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Graphviz

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1.Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree.
2.Analyze overfitting and control tree depth.
3.Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy.
4.Interpret feature importances.
5.Evaluate using cross-validation.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task  

**What I Learned:**  
- How to build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression.
- How to split and standardize data for better model performance.
- How to train and evaluate a model using metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- How the sigmoid function works and converts outputs to probabilities.
- Gained hands-on experience in implementing Logistic Regression in Python.
