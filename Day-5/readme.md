# Day-4: Classification with Logistic Regression.

**Objective:**  
Build a binary classifier using logistic regression.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1.Choose a binary classification dataset.
2.Train/test split and standardize features.
3.Fit a Logistic Regression model.
4.Evaluate with confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC-AUC.
5.Tune threshold and explain sigmoid function.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task  

**What I Learned:**  
- How to build a binary classifier using Logistic Regression.
- How to split and standardize data for better model performance.
- How to train and evaluate a model using metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
- How the sigmoid function works and converts outputs to probabilities.
- Gained hands-on experience in implementing Logistic Regression in Python.
