# Day-5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

**Objective:**  
Learn tree-based models for classification & regression.

**Tools Used:**  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Graphviz

**Task Overview / Mini Guide:**  
1.Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree.
2.Analyze overfitting and control tree depth.
3.Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy.
4.Interpret feature importances.
5.Evaluate using cross-validation.

**Folder Contents:**  
- `data/` – The dataset file(s)  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts or notebooks  
- `visualizations/` – Plots generated during the task  

**What I Learned:**  
- Trained and visualized a Decision Tree classifier.
- Understood overfitting and controlled it using tree depth.
- Built a Random Forest and compared its accuracy with the Decision Tree.
- Learned to interpret feature importance for model insights.
- Evaluated models using cross-validation for better reliability.
